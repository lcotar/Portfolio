    "header": "About me",
    "text": "I have been interested in computer technology since my school days and have taught myself a lot of IT skills. In addition, I successfully completed an apprenticeship as a computer scientist EFZ specializing in systems engineering. Since then, I have been working with Windows and am well versed in network technologies and Linux. I have always been enthusiastic about technology. In programming, I have finally found a tool that allows me to actively create something myself—not just consume it. The world is becoming increasingly digital, and programming is a key skill for the future. That's why I am inspired to constantly learn new technologies and tools. I am improving my programming skills so that I can implement my projects even more efficiently, user-friendly, and innovatively. The more I learn, the greater my possibilities become-this motivates me enormously to constantly develop myself further.",
    "location": "I live in Zurich. I am open to working on-site or remotely. I am willing to relocate to a specific city or location. It is important to me that I have the opportunity to take such an important step.",
    "openMinded": "I am very open-minded and curious when it comes to new technologies. I see every new technology as an opportunity to continuously expand my skills and broaden my horizons. Whether through online courses or personal projects, I regularly work on keeping my skills up to date. This continuous development is what makes the IT world so appealing to me.",
    "description": "I see challenges as opportunities, as I can learn something from every problem I encounter. Through analytical thinking, I recognize patterns and often find targeted solutions. Creativity helps me find new solutions when standard methods don't work. Teamwork often leads to particularly efficient and elegant results."
